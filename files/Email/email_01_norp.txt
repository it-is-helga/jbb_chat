Dear Ms. Stravinsky:

Subject: Guest Lecture
The members of the Freeport chapter of the National Organization of Retired Persons would indeed be interested in a lecture on “Recent Changes in the Financing of Medicare”. Therefore, with much appreciation, I accept your offer to address our club.

The NORP meets every Tuesday at 8 P.M. in the auditorium of Freeport High School. The programs for our meetings through November 20 have already been established. However, I will call you in a few days to schedule a date for your lecture for the first Tuesday after the 20th that meets your convenience.

The membership and I look forward to your lecture on a topic so important to us all.

Sincerely yours,
NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF RETIRED PERSONS
Henry Purcell
