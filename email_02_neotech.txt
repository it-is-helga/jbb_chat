Dear Sir or Madam:

Subject: Laser Printer/Copier

We intend to purchase a new laser printer/copier before the end of the fiscal year. We would like to consider a NeoTech copier and wonder if you have a model that would suit our needs.

Our office is small, and a laser printer/copier would generally be used by only three staff members. We run approximately 3000 copies a month and prefer a machine with fax capability.

We would also like to know about your warranty and repair service.
Since our fiscal year ends September 30, 2020, we hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely yours,
William Wilson
Office Manager
